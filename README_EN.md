## 💡 Usage Scenarios

To better understand how the bot helps in achieving goals, let's consider a few scenarios:

### 🌟 Scenario 1: Setting Your First Goal

Let's say your goal is "Write a book in 3 months, dedicating 2 hours цьому daily."

1.  **You**: `/start`
    **Bot**: 🤖 Hello! I'm your personal goal assistant... Press `/setgoal` to begin!
2.  **You**: `/setgoal`
    **Bot**: What goal do you want to achieve? Describe it in as much detail as possible.
3.  **You**: Write a book "My Adventures in the World of Code"
    **Bot**: What is the deadline for achieving your goal (e.g., 'in 2 months', 'in 6 weeks', 'in 50 days')? Please specify a period up to 3 months.
4.  **You**: in 3 months
    **Bot**: How much time are you approximately willing to dedicate to achieving your goal daily (e.g., '30 minutes', '1-2 hours')?
5.  **You**: 2 hours a day
    **Bot**: Generating your personal plan... This might take a moment.
    *(After a short while)*
    **Bot**: ✅ Your goal *Write a book "My Adventures in the World of Code"* is set! The plan has been saved.
    📄 [Open Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SPREADSHEET_LINK)

    Use `/today` to see today's task, and `/check` to mark it as complete.
6.  **You**: `/today`
    **Bot**: 📅 Task for today (DD.MM.YYYY, Weekday):
    📝 Outline the first chapter of the book.
    Status: Not completed
7.  **Вы**: `/check` -> (select "✅ Done" via buttons)
    **Bot**: Status updated! 💪
8.  **You**: `/status`
    **Bot**: (shows progress, e.g., 🎯 *Goal*: Write a book... 📊 *Progress*: 1% (✅ 1/90 days)...)

### ☀️ Scenario 2: Daily Interaction

1.  *(Morning)* **Bot** (automatic reminder, if configured):
    ☀️ Good morning! Time to tackle today's task for your goal!
    📝 Your task: Write 5 pages of text for the second chapter.
2.  **You**: (work on the task during the day)
3.  **You**: `/check` -> (select "✅ Done")
    **Bot**: Status updated! 💪
4.  **You**: `/motivation`
    **Bot**: Great job! Every step brings you closer to your dream. Keep up the pace! ✨

## 📖 Building API Documentation (Sphinx)

The project's API documentation is generated from docstrings using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/).

**To build the documentation locally:**

1.  Ensure you are in an activated virtual environment with all dependencies installed (including those in the `# --- Documentation ---` section of `requirements.txt`).
2.  Navigate to the `docs/` directory:
    ```bash
    cd docs
    ```
3.  Run the build command:
    *   For Linux/macOS/Git Bash:
        ```bash
        make html
        ```
    *   For Windows (CMD/PowerShell):
        ```bash
        .\make.bat html
        ```
4.  The generated documentation will be available in the `docs/build/html/` directory. Open `index.html` in your browser.
